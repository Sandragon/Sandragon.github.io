I want to learn to code because it’s fun. I love puzzles and coding is like a game. I also want to be more relevant in the future and do something that makes me a bigger and better contributor to society. But starting something new and exciting is easy. Following through is hard. 

I’m so very late with my blog post assignment. Everything that I could say has already been said. Likely by someone far more eloquent and well versed than I. 

I scan the Slack chat rooms feeling like a creeper who was invited to the party by accident. I see the current and former careers of other students. Mostly well educated professionals. How dare I, with my silly little Humanities degree, waste the time of these clearly far superior people? 

How can I manage to scrape together the time to succeed at this? What if I’m not able to keep up? What if I ask a stupid question? Am I too old to be trying to change my career?

Then it dawns on me.

WHO. CARES.

Who cares if it’s already been said. If a single person gets anything at all of value then it was worth writing. So what if my former education and career weren’t as high profile as some others? So what if I’m slow? I may slide into home plate 4 months late with my toddler on my back and a mile long list of unattended chores to do. but as long as I get there, who cares? If I ask a stupid question at least I’ll get an answer. And I may be older than the average student but nobody really needs to know that now do they?
